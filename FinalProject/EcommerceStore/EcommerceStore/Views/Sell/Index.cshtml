    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        Sellers create listings by uploading photos, setting a price. 
        Buyers browse by category,use filters (price, condition), and can
        message sellers to ask questions or negotiate.

    <h2>For Buyers: Browse, Compare, Buy</h2>
    <p>
        Buyers can search by keyword, filter by category or location, and save favorite sellers. Each
        listing displays seller ratings, recent reviews, and shipping estimates so buyers can compare
        items at a glance and make informed decisions.
