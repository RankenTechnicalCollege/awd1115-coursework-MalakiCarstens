    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        Sellers create listings by uploading photos, setting a price.
        Buyers browse by category, use filters (price, condition), and can
        message sellers to ask questions or negotiate.

    <h2>For Sellers: Create Great Listings</h2>
    <p>
        Create high-converting listings with clear titles, multiple high-quality photos, and a detailed
        description outlining condition, dimensions, and any imperfections. We provide tips and an easy
